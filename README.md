# Heart Disease Prediction – EDA & ML

End-to-end machine learning project on heart disease prediction using a clinical dataset.

## Project overview

- Performed data cleaning (handling `'?'`, type conversion, and missing values with median imputation).
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations and a correlation heatmap.
- Built a Logistic Regression model with train–test split (80/20) and feature scaling using StandardScaler.
- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.

## Tech stack

- Python, pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (train_test_split, StandardScaler, LogisticRegression, metrics)
- Kaggle Notebooks
